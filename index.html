        <p>
          With your help, we can respond to these disasters and save lives.
          Thanks to you, in the last year alone we were able to provide more
          than 2 million women, men and children in 10 different countries with
          humanitarian aid and disaster response. When you give, you help us
          with both immediate response and risk reduction activities.

            <h3>Food For a Family</h3>
            <p>
              Food is the third most important thing for living beings to
              provide energy and development, maintain life, or stimulate growth
              after air and water. It is one of the most complicated sets of
              chemicals.

            <h3>Shelter For a Family</h3>
            <p>
              Shelter separates people from their surroundings. It provides a
              place for families to cook, eat, sleep, and raise their children.
              It protects them from extreme temperatures, strong winds, and
              storms.

            <h3>Education For a Child</h3>
            <p>
              We believe that every child deserves access to a quality
              education. We transform lives in rural communities through
              technology and innovative solutions.
