        <h1>Let's Help Those Who Are In Need</h1>
        <p>
          With your help, we can respond to these disasters and save lives.
          Thanks to you, in the last year alone we were able to provide more
          than 2 million women, men and children in 10 different countries with
          humanitarian aid and disaster response. When you give, you help us
          with both immediate response and risk reduction activities.
